#### Product Funnel Analysis:

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

<ul>
  <li>How many times was each product viewed?</li>
  <li>How many times was each product added to cart?</li>
  <li>How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?</li>
  <li>How many times was each product purchased?</li>
</ul>

```sql
WITH products_cte AS (
SELECT *
FROM
clique_bait.page_hierarchy
WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
),

detailed_cte AS(
SELECT
all_product.product_id as prod_id,
all_product.page_name as prod_name,
events.*,
events.page_id as event_page,
products_cte.product_id as viewed_product_id,
cart.product_id as cart_product_id,
   CASE
     WHEN MAX (CASE WHEN events.page_id = 13 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER
(PARTITION BY visit_id) = 0
     THEN 1
     ELSE 0
   END AS but_not_purchased,

          CASE
     WHEN MAX (CASE WHEN events.page_id = 13 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER
(PARTITION BY visit_id) = 1
     THEN 1
     ELSE 0
   END AS purchased

FROM
clique_bait.events
left JOIN

products_cte as all_product ON events.page_id = all_product.page_id

left JOIN
products_cte ON events.page_id = products_cte.page_id AND
events.event_type = 1

LEFT JOIN products_cte as cart ON events.page_id = cart.page_id AND
events.event_type = 2

ORDER BY visit_id,sequence_number ASC)

SELECT
prod_id,
prod_name,
sum(case WHEN viewed_product_id is not null then 1 else 0 END) as
views_count,
sum(case WHEN cart_product_id is not null then 1 else 0 END) as
added_to_cart_count,
sum(case WHEN but_not_purchased = 1 AND cart_product_id is not null then
1 else 0 END) as but_not_purchased_count,
sum(case WHEN purchased = 1 AND cart_product_id is not null then 1 else
0 END) as purchased_count
from detailed_cte
WHERE prod_id is not NULL
GROUP BY prod_id,prod_name
;
```

#### Campaigns Analysis:

In this part firstaval i did cleaning on clique_bait.campaign_identifier table because it is not normalized!

1NF normalization: a single cell must not hold more than one value (atomicity) 

clique_bait.campaign_identifier Table:
| campaign_id | products | campaign_name                     | start_date               | end_date                 |
